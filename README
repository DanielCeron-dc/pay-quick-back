# payQuickBackend Setup

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Prisma** (you can install it globally using \`npm install -g prisma\`)

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd payQuickBackend
   \`\`\`

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies by running:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Generate Prisma Client**

   Run the following command to generate the Prisma client:

   \`\`\`bash
   npx prisma generate
   \`\`\`

4. **Create SQLite Database and Initial Migration**

   Initialize the database and apply the initial migration by running:

   \`\`\`bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   \`\`\`

5. **Running the Backend**

   Start the backend server:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm run start
   \`\`\`

   The backend will be running at \`http://localhost:3000\`. You can also access it remotely on [https://updated-backend-sqlite-no-env.fly.dev](https://updated-backend-sqlite-no-env.fly.dev).

6. **Running Unit Tests**

   Please note that the unit tests are **not finished**. You can run the existing tests using:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm run test
   \`\`\`

## Frontend Integration

The frontend is already integrated with the backend running at [https://updated-backend-sqlite-no-env.fly.dev](https://updated-backend-sqlite-no-env.fly.dev). Make sure the frontend is configured to send requests to this backend.

## Notes

- The backend uses SQLite as its database.
- Ensure that Prisma is properly set up and the migrations are applied to reflect the database schema.
- You may need to adjust environment variables and configurations based on your local or deployment environment.
